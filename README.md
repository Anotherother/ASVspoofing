  model.py: model I used, including dnn, cnn, and a multi input dnn with each input corresponding to a setence
  train_cnn_mfcc.py: cnn + mfcc
  train_cnn.py: cnn + cqcc
  train_mfcc.py: dnn + mfcc
  train_cqcc.py: dnn + cqcc

  I tried cnn and dnn with separately mfcc and cqcc.
  The best result I got is cqcc+cnn with accuracy about 23.47%
